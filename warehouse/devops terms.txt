scalability(multiple contaiers of same app has 
too run. You need to configure a load bala
ncer[nginx] to pass the load properly to the 
multiple containers.(4 nginx,10 app containers))

High availabilty:(clustering mechnism.
need to install the containers in to multiple
vms.(2 vms: 1: 2 nginx,5 app containers.
			2: 2 nginx,5 app containers.) 
If one vm goes down. The cluster s/w
will redirect to request to some other vm)

resilience:In the above HA one vm goes down, How many containers are available?
2 nginx and 5 app container this will reduce your scalability to 50 %.

Once the vm goes down, automatically the containers which are runnning in the down vm
has to push to the vm whih is available.

MATSER SLAVE CONCEPT:

The cluster software(docker-swarm, kubernetes) will install in the master vm.
The app container will run on the slave nodes.
in slave nodes there is an agent to ping by this master.
